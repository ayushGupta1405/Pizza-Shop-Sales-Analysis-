## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data using MySQL. The goal is to uncover key insights into sales patterns, customer preferences, and revenue distribution to support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Goals

### Basic:
1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

### Intermediate:
1. Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
2. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
3. Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
4. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
5. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

### Advanced:
1. Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
2. Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
3. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

## Data Analysis Process
The analysis was conducted using MySQL to execute various queries that provided insights into the pizza sales data. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Data Retrieval:** Extracted data from multiple tables to generate a comprehensive dataset.
2. **Basic Analysis:** Calculated total orders, total revenue, identified the highest-priced pizza, most common pizza size, and the top 5 most ordered pizza types.
3. **Intermediate Analysis:** Joined tables to determine the total quantity of each pizza category, distribution of orders by hour, category-wise distribution, and average number of pizzas ordered per day.
4. **Advanced Analysis:** Calculated the percentage revenue contribution of each pizza type, analyzed cumulative revenue, and identified top 3 most ordered pizza types by revenue for each category.
